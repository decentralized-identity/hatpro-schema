[**WG projects** ](https://github.com/decentralized-identity?q=wg-ht&type=&language=) | [ DIF page ](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/hospitality-travel-wg.html) | [Mailing list and Wiki ](https://lists.identity.foundation/g/hospitalityandtravel-wg/) | [Meeting recordings](https://identity.foundation/recordings)

_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_This document is live-edited DURING each call, and stable/authoritative copies live on our github repo under /agenda.md . 
Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd._
